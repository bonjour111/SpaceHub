# SpaceHub - Spaceflight Tracker ðŸš€
SpaceHub is an open-source app that aims to improve knowledge and accessibility on spaceflights for people around the globe. The source code is open source under the GPLv3 Licence and is built by following modern Android Development like Hilt, Coroutines, Flows, JetPack and designed with the new Material Design 3 guidelines.

# Disclaimer - Project Under Development ðŸš§
This project is a work in progress and under development. It may contain uncompleted features, bugs and it may be subject to changes during this stage. **The first v1 stable version will be released in the Google Play Store in Q1 2023.**

## Project Setup / Before building the app
Is a bad practice to store API Keys inside Git Repositories so you will need to add them manually or the project won't compile.

Please, add the Google MAPS API Key inside the `local.properties` file in the root directory of the project:
```
sdk.dir=/Users/tonystark/Library/Android/sdk
MAPS_API_KEY=yourApiKey
```
Note: If you want to test the project without Google Maps functionality you can add a fake Google Maps API key like `MAPS_API_KEY=1234`

For designing this app, I used Figma, one of the industry standard tools used by Designers for creating UI and UX for mobile and Desktop. I will post the artboard links soon.

## API
SpaceHub uses the open APIs from [Launch Library 2](https://thespacedevs.com/llapi) and [Spaceflight News API
](https://thespacedevs.com/snapi) for collecting the Spaceflights information.
