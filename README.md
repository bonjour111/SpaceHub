## Disclaimer - Project Under Development üöß
This project is a work in progress and under development. It may contain uncompleted features, bugs and it may be subject to changes during this stage. **The first v1 stable version will be released in the Google Play Store in Q1 2023.**

## Project Setup / Before building 
Is a bad practice to store API Keys inside Git Repositories so you will need to add them manually or the project won't compile.

Please, add the Google Maps API Key inside your `local.properties` file in the root directory of the project:
```
sdk.dir=/Users/tonystark/Library/Android/sdk
MAPS_API_KEY=yourApiKey
```
Note: If you want to test the project without Google Maps functionality you can add a fake Google Maps API key like `MAPS_API_KEY=1234`

## Design
For designing this app, I used Figma, one of the industry standard design tools for creating UI and UX for mobile and Desktop. **I will post the artboard links soon.**

## API
SpaceHub uses APIs from [Launch Library 2](https://thespacedevs.com/llapi) and [Spaceflight News API
](https://thespacedevs.com/snapi) for collecting the Spaceflights information.
